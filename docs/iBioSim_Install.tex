\section{General Requirements}

\noindent
There are versions of {\tt iBioSim} available for Windows, Linux, and
MacOS.  You can download the appropriate installation file from:\\
%%tth:\begin{html}<a href="http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/iBioSim/">\end{html}
{\tt http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/iBioSim}
%%tth:\begin{html}</a>\end{html}
\\ {\tt iBioSim} requires that you have 
%%tth:\begin{html}<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">\end{html}
Java Runtime Environment 1.5
%%tth:\begin{html}</a>\end{html}
or higher install on your system.  It is also useful to have 
%%tth:\begin{html}<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">\end{html}
Graphviz.
%%tth:\begin{html}</a>\end{html}
Also, you should associate files with a ``.dot'' extension with the 
{\tt Graphviz} tool, and files with the ``.xhtml'' extension to your
web browswer.

\section{Installation on Windows}

\noindent
Download and execute {\tt iBioSim-$\langle$version$\rangle$-Setup.exe}.\\
The installation uses InstallJammer.  It first asks you for your
preferred installation language.  Make your selection and press {\tt OK}.

The next screen tells you that you what version you are installing.
Press {\tt Next} to continue.

Next, it ask you for an installation location.  Please make sure to
select a path that does not have any spaces or special symbols as
these cause problems with {\tt iBioSim}.

\includegraphics[height=95mm]{screenshots/location}

You are now ready to install.  Press {\tt Next} to continue.

\includegraphics[height=95mm]{screenshots/confirm}

\clearpage

You are all done.  Press {\tt Finish}.  If selected, {\tt iBioSim}
will launch immediately.  Otherwise, you can start it using your
desktop shortcut or from your start menu.

\includegraphics[height=95mm]{screenshots/finish}

In your start menu, there should be an option to uninstall.  If you
select this, it will ask if you are sure then proceed to completely
remove {\tt iBioSim} from your system.  It is highly recommended that
you remove {\tt iBioSim} using this uninstall procedure before
installing a new version.

\section{Installation on Linux}

\noindent
Since InstallJammmer is also used for the Linux install, the
installation instructions are essentially the same.
First, download {\tt iBioSim-$\langle$version$\rangle$-Linux-x86-Install}.
Open a terminal and browse to where this file was download.  You must
make this file executable:\\
{\tt chmod u+x iBioSim-$\langle$version$\rangle$-Linux-x86-Install}.
You should then execute this file:\\
{\tt ./iBioSim-$\langle$version$\rangle$-Linux-x86-Install}.
This starts InstallJammer.  It first asks you for your
preferred installation language.  Make your selection and press {\tt OK}.

select a path that does not have any spaces or special symbols as
these cause problems with {\tt iBioSim}.

will launch immediately.  Otherwise, you can start it using your
desktop shortcut or from your start menu.

In your start menu, there should be an option to uninstall.  If you

remove {\tt iBioSim} from your system.  It is highly recommended that
you remove {\tt iBioSim} using this uninstall procedure before
installing a new version.

Note that since there are a large number of different linux installations, there can be problems especially with older installations.  If you are having problems though, first log out and back in.  There are some environment variables that need to be set.  If you are still having problems, then read on.
Our linux installations are currently built for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Fedora 15.  While the Java parts of our program port smoothly, there are often issues with the dynamic libraries and the C/C++ programs {\tt reb2sac} and {\tt GeneNet}.  If you are having a problem, the first step is to download and build libsbml Version 5.0.  You will need to replace the libsbml.so* and libsbmlj.so files with your build of libsbml in either lib or lib64 depending on whether you are using a 32-bit or 64-bit machine.  At this point, you should be able to start {\tt iBioSim}.  However, if you are still having problems, send an email to {\tt myers@ece.utah.edu} including information about your OS and any error messages when you try to execute {\tt iBioSim} from the command line.

You should also now test {\tt reb2sac} and {\tt GeneNet}.  In your install directory, try the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item cd bin
\item export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=\$BIOSIM/lib:\$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH \\
Note that this is for bash shell, so you may need to change for your shell, if not bash.
\item ./reb2sac
\item ./GeneNet
\end{itemize}
You should see the usage lines for these programs.  If you do not, you may need custom builds, contact {\tt myers@ece.utah.edu}.

\section{Installation on MacOS}

\noindent
To install on MacOS, you need to download {\tt iBioSim.dmg}.  You should
open this file with {\tt DiskImageMounter.app}.  This should open up
this disk image in {\tt finder}.  You should then
double-click on the {\tt iBioSim} package.  

\includegraphics[height=95mm]{screenshots/finder}

This starts the {\tt iBioSim} installer.  Press {\tt Continue} to go on.

\includegraphics[height=95mm]{screenshots/intro}

You should now select the drive you wish to install on.  {\tt iBioSim}
will be installed in your {\tt Applications} directory on this drive.

\includegraphics[height=95mm]{screenshots/destination}

\includegraphics[height=95mm]{screenshots/select}

It will then tell you how much space it will take and allow you to
confirm that you wish to install by pressing {\tt Install}.

\includegraphics[height=95mm]{screenshots/installType}

You should then get a message that it installed correct.  At this
point, you should be able to use {\tt Finder} and locate {\tt iBioSim}
in your {\tt Applications} directory.  {\tt iBioSim} is started by
double-clicking on it.
