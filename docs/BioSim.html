<h1><a name="PROJECTS"></a>Projects</h1>
A project is a collection of model and data files.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2><a name="NEWPROJ"></a>Creating projects</h2>
To create a new project, select the File drop down menu from the toolbar and select "New Project" under the New option.  You will then be prompted to browse to a desired location for and to give a name to the project directory.  After you do this, click the new button and a new project directory will be created.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2><a name="OPENPROJ"></a>Opening projects</h2>
To open a project, select the File drop down menu from the toolbar and select "Open Project" under the Open option.  You will then be prompted to browse to a project directory that you want to open.  After you select the project directory, click open and the project will open.
<br>&nbsp;

<h1><a name="MODELS"></a>MODELS</h1>
A model is a representation of biochemical reaction networks.  A model can represent metabolic networks, cell-signaling pathways, regulatory networks, and other kinds of systems studied in systems biology.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2><a name="NEWMODEl"></a>Creating SBML models</h2>
To create a new SBML model, you must first have a project open.  Once this is done, select the File drop down menu from the toolbar and select "New Model" under the New option.  You will then be prompted to give a model id.  Once an id is entered, an SBML editor will open in a new tab.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2><a name="IMPORTSBML"></a>Importing SBML models</h2>
To import an SBML model, you must first have a project open.  Once this is done, select the File drop down menu from the toolbar and select "SBML" under the Import option.  You will then be prompted to select a model to import.  Select a desired model and click the open button to import the SBML model into the project.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2><a name="SBMLEDIT"></a>Editing SBML models</h2>
<p>To edit an SBML model, you must first have a project open.  Once this is done, right click on the model you want to edit and select "Edit".  This will open up an SBML editor in a new tab.  You can also edit an SBML model that is part of an analysis by right clicking on an analysis directory, by selecting "Open Analysis View", and then by selecting the "SBML Editor" tab.</p>
<h3>Adding, Editing, And Removing</h3>
<ul>
<li>To add a new item, click on one of the add buttons.  You will then be prompted to provide a unique id and some properties for this new item.  After you have filled out all of the required fields, click add and the new item will be added to the SBML model.</li>
<li>To edit an existing item, select that item from the list and click the edit button.  An editing window will open and you will be able to change the properties of that item.  When you are done editing this item, click save to save the changes to the item.</li>
<li>To remove an item from the model, select that item and click the remove button.  The item will then be removed from the model.  However, if you try to remove a species that is used in a reaction, you will first have to remove the reaction or remove the species from the reaction in order to remove the species from the model.  Likewise, if you try to remove a compartment that contains species, you will have to remove the species before you will be able to remove the compartment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kinetic Law Formula Syntax</h3>
Kinetic law formulas are expressed as text strings using a simple C-like syntax.  Here are some syntax rules when dealing with kinetic law formulas:
<ul>
<li>Acceptable operators include add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/)</li>
<li>Supported functions include:
<ul>
<li>abs(x) - Absolute Value</li>
<li>acos(x) - Arc Cosine</li>
<li>asin(x) - Arc Sine</li>
<li>atan(x) - Arc Tangent</li>
<li>ceil(x) - Ceiling</li>
<li>cos(x) - Cosine</li>
<li>exp(x) - e^x</li>
<li>floor(x) - Floor</li>
<li>log(x) - Natural Log</li>
<li>log(#, x) - Log Base #</li>
<li>sqr(x) - Squared</li>
<li>pow(x, y) - x^y</li>
<li>sqrt(x) - Square Root</li>
<li>root(#, x) - x to the # root</li>
<li>sin(x) - Sine</li>
<li>tan(x) - Tangent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acceptable variables include anything listed in the products, reactants, or parameter fields.</li>
<li>Real Numbers can also be entered into a kinetic law formula.</li>
</ul>
The kinetic law editor also includes two buttons.  The "Use Mass Action" button will compute a mass action formula for you and enter it into the kinetic law editor.  The "Clear" button will clear the kinetic law editor.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2><a name="VIEWSBML"></a>Viewing SBML models</h2>
To view an SBML model, you must first have a project open.  Once this is done, right click on the model you want to view.  There are two ways to view a model.  You can either select the "View As Graph" option or the "View In Browser" option.  The "View As Graph" option will convert the model to a dot file and then will open that file with dotty.  The "View In Browser" option will covert the model to an xhtml file and will open that file with firefox.
<br>&nbsp;

<h1><a name="ANALYSIS"></a>Analysis</h1>
To perform analysis, you must first have a project open.  Once this is done, right click on a model and select "Create Analysis View".  You will then be prompted to give a name to your analysis.  After a name is entered, a tab with analysis options will open.  You can also open up an analysis tab by right clicking on an analysis directory and selecting "Open Analysis View".
<br>&nbsp;

<h2><a name="SIMULATION"></a>Simulation</h2>
Hiro please fill in here, add sections if you like.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2><a name="LEARNING"></a>Learning</h2>
<p>The learning tab in the BioSim toolkit is use to try and understand
the workings between species in a genetic regulatory network.  The
learning algorithm is applied to time series data that can either be
manually entered, or simulated from an sbml file.  The learning
algorithm implemented in BioSim is based on the work by Barker
et.al. </p>

<h3>Learning network connectivity from simulated data</h3>
<ul>

<li>Select the species that you do not wish to learn connections to or from by clicking the checkbox 
  in the "Do Not Learn" section next to the species name</li>
<li>Click the "Learn" button</li>
<li>A network is now shown.  The nodes in the graph are the selected species, and the verticies of the graph are the activation and repression connections.  An activation connection is shown with a blue arrow and a repression connection is shown with a red tee.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic Options</h3>
<ul>
<li>Background Knowledge Network</li>

<p>The Background Knowledge Network field allows the user to input
known information reguarding the network of interest.  The names of
these species must match the names used in the simulation
directory.</p>

<li>For Vote Threshold (Tf)</li>
<p>Tf is a threshold passed to the Score function which is used to
    cast a vote in favor of an influence vector when a probability
    ratio is greater than this threshold value.</p>

<li>Against Vote Threshold (Ta)</li>
<p>Ta is a threshold passed to the Score function which is used to
    cast a vote against an influence vector when a probability ratio
    is less than this threshold value.</p>

<li>First Round IV Threshold (Ti)</li>
<p>Ti is a threshold passed to the Score function representing the score of an influence vector
    with no influences in it (i.e. |i|=0)</p>

<li>Pre-competition IV Filter Threshold (Tp)</li>
<p>Tp is a threshold value used in the CombineInfluenceVectors algorithm to filter or remove low
    scoring influence vectors before competing them</p>

<li>Merge IVs delta (Tm)</li>
<p>Tm is a threshold value used in the CombineInfluenceVectors
algorithm to determine if two influence vectors have a close enough
score to even be considered for merging.</p>

<li>Minimum Initial Vectors (Tn)</li>
<p> Tn is a threshold value used in the CreateInfluenceVectorSet
      algorithm and represents the minimum number of influence vectors
      constructed in this algorithm</p>

<li>Max Vector Size (Tj)</li>
<p>Tj is a threshold value used in the CombineInfluenceVectors
      algorithm to determine the maximal size of merged influence
      vectors</p>

<li>Relax Thresholds Delta (Tr)</li>
<p>Tr is a threshold value used when relaxing thresholds</p>

<li>Number of Bins</li>
<p>The Number of Bins value specifies how many values the encoded time series data can assume</p>

<li>Use User Generated Levels</li>
<p>The User Generated Levels radio button allows the user to provide specific data value cuttofs for encoding the data</p>

<ul>
<li>The Suggest Cuttofs Button</li>
<p>The Suggest Cuttofs Button pre-populates the cuttof fields with
cuttofs that try to maximize the number of data points in each bin</p>

</ul>

<li>The Do Not Use checkbox</li>
<p>The Do Not Use checkbox allows the user to specify which species to include when learning network connectivity</p>

</ul>
